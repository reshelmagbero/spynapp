# Spyn Project Management 

Spyn was designed with a user-centered approach, focusing on simplicity and ease of use. The app’s design prioritizes the user experience by providing an intuitive interface that enables users to easily navigate the app’s features. 

## Implemented Functionalities

Onboarding- 
After the app has been downloaded and installed, this is the Welcome Screen. This serves as the initial point for each user journey within the application.

Log-in- 
Users with existing accounts can sign in using their registered email or phone number. In addition, users have the convenience of signing in using their Gmail or Facebook account.

Home- 
Display a brief information about the project. Provide you with all the necessary information about how the work flows.

Project Detail- 
The task contains a detailed description, subtask and deadline. Users can add a comment and upload the necessary attachment file which helps to user updates in the project.

Message and Chat- 
This is the page where teams can communicate real-time with the project, improve team collaboration and productivity.

Video Call- 
Another functionality is a real-time video-calling specifically created to facilitate meaningful and enjoyable interactions with coworkers, regardless of their location.
